###This is a writeup for the Hack The Box 'Sherlock' called 'Meerkat'. This was one of the first 'sherlocks' released on the platform, and it was an interesting problem. ###

on the pcap file provided, a service called bonitasoft was running

attacker tried perform credential stuffing on the service, and got initial access through compromised credentials

CVE-2022-25237 was used to obtain rce on the service

attacker used MITRE technique T1098.004 to gain persistence on the machine

###Full Disclosure; I didn't really know what the writeup format was supposed to be like for sherlocks, so this may appear a little lackluster###
