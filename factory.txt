###This is a writeup for the Hack The Box challenge 'Factory'. Simple challenge, but invaluable for learning more about PLC and modbus.###

connected to interface using nc

three commands are available, status of the system, sending a modbus command, and exit

running 1, found that system is in auto_mode

sent 520526DBFF00 to 2 to start manual_mode

running 1 again, see that its in manual_mode

problem seems to be that low and high sensors are corrupted and the tank needs to be emptied to get the flag

checking the diagram, it seems that if cutoff_in is on and manual_mode mode is on, stop_in is on

sent 5205001AFF00 to 2

then, to clear the tank, send 52050538FF00 to set force_start_out to on

got flag
