###This is a writeup for the Hack The Box machine 'Broker'. User was just google-fu, but root gives a small lesson as to how webservers are set up and run.###

initial scan shows ports 22 and 80 open

checked website on port 80, required credentials

ran a full nmap scan, shows activemq service running on port 61616

searching for activemq cves, found CVE-2023-46604

obtained shell as user activemq

got user.txt

checking sudo, user can run nginx as root

to get root.txt, spawned a new webserver on port 1234, location as / directory

used curl localhost:1234, doesn't work since an index file was not specified 

but if a filename is specified (curl localhost:1234/etc/passwd), it works

got root.txt
